        <p>Cultivation: Coffee plants are mainly grown in tropical regions around the world, with Brazil being the largest producer followed by Vietnam and Colombia. The plants require specific conditions, such as a suitable climate, altitude, rainfall, and soil type, to thrive.
            Processing: After the coffee cherries are harvested, they undergo processing to remove the outer layers and extract the coffee beans. There are two primary methods of processing: the dry method (natural process) and the wet method (washed process). Each method contributes to the coffee's flavor profile.</p>
            
        <p>Roasting: Coffee beans are typically roasted before they are brewed. Roasting brings out the flavors and aromas by transforming the chemical composition of the beans. The level of roasting can range from light to dark, each resulting in a different taste profile.
            Brewing: There are numerous ways to brew coffee, including drip brewing, espresso, French press, pour-over, AeroPress, and more. Each method involves combining ground coffee with water in specific proportions and extracting the flavors and compounds to create the desired cup of coffee.</p>
